      "\n",
      "That’s because a city’s restaurant scene is a good indicator of its history and the kind of people who live there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also a good idea to try what a city is known for; whether it’s hot dogs in Chicago or a slice of New York pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, it’s always nice to eat outside and enjoy a good meal when you’re traveling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if it rains, you can always take things indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thrillist says that’s not the case when you plan your trip around excursions, since bad weather can ruin your day of sightseeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it’s a road trip, ditch the gas station food for several stops along the way, even if they’re out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think mom-and-pop restaurants you looked up beforehand or random farm stands, according to Bravo TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Driving the open road can be boring, but fun food finds make things exciting!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re a planner, Delish recommends leaving some wiggle room in your food quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means asking someone at the hotel front desk where they like to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a better chance the place will be packed with locals instead of tourists, giving you a better taste of what the city has to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Museums are great for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you planned your trip around excursions and sightseeing, chances are you’ll be asked by friends, “how was the food?”\n",
      "\n",

Legal and media analyst Lionel joins In Question to discuss. (5:14). Protests are erupting across Iraq over concerns about poor public services, alleged corruption and unemployment.

The three MLAs, V Saminathan, KG Shankar and S Selvaganapathy, were nominated by Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi without consulting Chief Minister V Narayanasamy. However, the ruling All India NR Congress objected to the entry of the three MLA, following which the Assembly speaker V. Vaithilingam adjourned the Assembly. Saminathan, Shankar, and Selvaganapathy were nominated by Kiran Bedi last year but were allegedly denied entry into the state Assembly.\n",

      "description:  New Delhi, Aug 01 (ANI): Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju reacted to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s statement on Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) draft. The WB CM had said that a civil war will break out over the NRC draft issued on Monday. Responding to this, Rijiju said, “Such statements don’t suit a chief minister. She should think of the message she is spreading.” The NRC draft list, released on Monday, has incorporated 2.89 crore people out of 3.29 crore applicants, leaving out nearly 40 lakh people in the state. The list was released in line with the directions of the Supreme Court to identify permanent residents and illegal migrants from Bangladesh.\n",

      "title:  3 in 5 babies not breastfed in first hour of life\n",
      "description:  New Delhi, Aug 01 (ANI): According to United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 78 million babies or a ratio of about three in every five newborns are not breastfed within the first hour of the birth. This puts them at a higher risk of death and disease, making them less likely to continue breastfeeding. Such babies are mostly born in low or middle income group countries. According to the report, newborns that breastfeed in the first hour of life are significantly more likely to survive. Even a delay of a few hours after birth could pose life-threatening consequences. It should be noted that skin-to-skin contact along with suckling at the breast stimulates the mother's production of breast milk, including colostrums, also called the baby’s ‘first vaccine’, which is extremely rich in nutrients and antibodies. Capture the Moment, which analyzed data from 76 countries, found that despite the importance of early initiation of breastfeeding, too many newborns are left waiting too long for different reasons, including: traditional norms of feeding babies formulas or honey first, rise in elective C-sections, and gap in quality of care provided to mothers and newborns. The report urges governments, donors and other decision-makers to adopt strong legal measures to restrict the marketing of infant formula and other breast milk substitutes.\n",

      "Ukraine. On Wednesday, the High Court of London passed a verdict on Kiev's $3 billion debt, which Poroshenko refuses to pay to Russia. The trial lasted for a little more than a year. As a result, the court ruled that Russia has good reasons to demand its money back, $3 billion, and an accumulated interest of $75 million. Also, the court found all of Ukraine's arguments not to pay, unjustifiable. Ukraine, of course, is going to protest this unfavorable decision in the Supreme Court of London. The procedure can take from several months to a year. Some observers, however, are confident that Russia won’t receive any money back in any case, since Ukraine in its present form will collapse as a state, and there will be no one to pay it back.\n",

This is the second visit of the head of state, and another confirmation of Russia's determination to defend its national interests in the Arctic. Once Joseph Stalin simply wrote on the globe \"Arctic Territories of the USSR.\" This is how active development of the North began. Since then, big progress has been made. Sailors and polar explorers became Soviet heroes and idols of the youth. A new Russia stepped up Arctic research, and work on the international legal recognition of our Arctic shelf. The topic is important, because only mineral resources in these areas are estimated at as much as $30 trillion. A planetary strategic resource. It's clear that in the current relations with the United States and NATO, it’s fundamentally important to protect our high latitudes with our military. Therefore, before taking part in the International Arctic Conference in Arkhangelsk, Putin visited a new Russian military base on Franz Josef Land.\n",

      "description:  Malaya was born in the village of Nova Blagovishchenka in Hornostaivka Raion, Kherson Oblast, of the Ukrainian SSR. According to doctors and medical records, she was a normal child at birth,[3] but later she was neglected by her alcoholic parents at an early age, and she lived surrounded by dogs.[2]When Oxana was found by authorities, she was seven and a half years old, but she could not talk, lacked many basic skills, and physically behaved like a dog. She was running around on all fours, barking, slept on the floor, and she ate and took care of her hygiene like a dog.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaya was eventually transferred to the foster home for mentally-disabled children in Barabol (rural Ovidiopol Raion of Odessa Oblast). She underwent years of specialized therapy and education to address her behavioural, social and educational issues. Upon adulthood, Oxana has been taught to subdue her dog-like behaviour, she learned to speak fluently and intelligently,[4] she works at the farm milking cows,[5][4] but remains somewhat intellectually impaired.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "In a British Channel 4 documentary, and in the Portuguese SIC channel documentary, her doctors stated that it is unlikely that she will ever be completely rehabilitated into \"normal\" society. In 2001 Russian TV channel \"NTV\" made a documentary about her life.[7] There have been multiple articles about her in the press.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, Oxana gave an interview on national Ukrainian TV, on the talk-show Govorit Ukraina, where she talked about herself and answered questions.[4] During the show Oxana said that she wants to be treated like a normal human being, and is offended when others call her a \"dog-girl\".[4] She said that she wants her brothers to visit her more often and that her main dream in her life is to find her biological mother.[4] She also talked about her boyfriend, her life in the state foster home and her work with animals on the farm.[4]\n",

      "￼(YouTube/Paula White Ministries)Paula White appears in a screen capture of a video from her ministry's YouTube channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Televangelist Paula White is asking her followers to donate as much as their entire salary for the month of January as \"first fruits\" offering so that they would enjoy \"blessings\" for the entire year, but she warns that they may suffer \"consequences\" if they fail to follow God's command.\n",
      "\n",
      "White, a pastor at New Destiny Christian Center in Apopka, Florida, explained on her website that the principle of first fruits is found throughout the Bible and said that it \"supernaturally unlocks amazing opportunity, blessing, favor and divine order for your life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is the basis or underlying support for your success in 2018. It is GOD'S PRINCIPLE OF FIRST FRUITS. All Firsts belong to God,\" she wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "White, who also serves as a spiritual adviser to President Donald Trump, said that honoring the principle would provide the \"foundation and structure for God's blessings and promises in your life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you don't honor it, whether through ignorance or direct disobedience there are consequences,\" she warned.\n",
      "\n",
      "She noted that the consequence could come in a form of a \"struggle\" and claimed that donors could be protected from it by giving a first fruit offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "White's church had expressed support for the campaign on Tuesday, but some have expressed doubts on whether this was how God intended the principle of first fruits to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The concept of biblical first fruits is real, but as I read your article I can't help but feel as though you're being manipulative. Laying the foundation for first fruits and then launching into a 'financial seed' campaign seems to be a misuse/abuse of the biblical intention,\" Christian mom Heather Norton wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some media outlets have noted that White owns a unit at a Trump property in New York and that she has drawn criticism for flaunting her wealth. Some religious leaders have questioned some of her teachings, such as the \"prosperity gospel,\" which holds that God rewards faith and giving to the church with financial blessings and good health. White, however, denied that she is a prosperity preacher and said that she does not see God as a \"sugar daddy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "CompellingTruth.org, an outreach effort by a group of trained Christian experts at Got Questions Ministries, noted that some preachers use the principle to encourage parishioners to give an offering above and beyond tithing, which is usually 10 percent of earnings. But the group noted that the Bible does not support it as a requirement for Christians.\n",

      "\n",
      "The program will be launched on Sunday at 6.30.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prophet Bushiri founder of Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG), a fast growing church with branches all over the world, said he was delighted that Zodiak has given him n opportunity to televise his programmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My team is ready organising the production of the programmes which starts this Sunday,” said Bushiri to Nyasa Times.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People should get ready for an explosion of God’s move. Let them see if I don’t preach salvation and lead many to Christ,” said Bushiri.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so happy because God has started fighting my battles,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Malawians who spoke to Nyasa Times gave positive reaction to the move by Zodiak to give Bushiri the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been hearing about Prophet Bushiri and his miracle money and it nice that I will be able to watch him on Zodiak and judge myself as I have heard  a lot of him and I don’t know whether it’s true or not,” said Owen Banda  from Area 18 in Lilongwe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bushiri also launched a Christian television station, Prophetic Channel which is on Free to Air and viewed by millions across the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our church services are characterised by unusual prophecies, healings, and all manner of miracles, he says attributing it to God’s Grace upon his life,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Malawian prophet relocated to South Africa in Pretoria where he launched another ECG church, which has grown to over 60,000 members.\n",
      "\n",
      "During live broadcasts on Prophetic Channel, shouts of ‘Major One’ as he is commonly called, break out in the audience as people cry out for the attention of the Man of God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, calls of ‘Major One, do something’ ring out as the desperate audience present their various needs to the Prophet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Apostle John Chi who was a right hand man of Nigerian Prophet TB Joshua attended ECG church service and hailed Bushiri as “great man of God”.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said: “Bushiri has stormed Africa with revival. If you deny him as true prophet then be ready to show us the true prophet which Jesus has given us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apostle Chi said: “I recognise prophet Bushiri as a true man of God.”\n",

      "Prophet Bushiri’s Ministry has however not been devoid of persecution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The usually immaculately dressed Man of God leans forward in his chair, and says, “gun shots have missed me countless times, I have escaped poisoning, faced legal suits, false accusations sometimes from fellow servants of God opposing my calling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this he says, “If you are at the top, you become the topic and if you are the head, you become the headline,” thereby refusing to be deterred by what he calls empty talk from his persecutors.\n",
      "He rather thanks God for what he terms as ‘Judas Iscariots’ in his life as they have strengthened his resolve to serve God and indirectly made his Ministry grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the Prophetic Ministry, Prophet Bushiri says it should not be viewed with contempt as it is significant to everyone and nations.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It’s not unusual for the department to send a van to transport all the criminals Ross arrests at this Walmart. The call log on the store stretches 126 pages, documenting more than 5,000 trips over the past five years. Last year police were called to the store and three other Tulsa Walmarts just under 2,000 times. By comparison, they were called to the city’s four Target stores about 300 times. Most of the calls to the northeast Supercenter were for shoplifting, but there’s no shortage of more serious crimes, including five armed robberies so far this year, a murder suspect who killed himself with a gunshot to the head in the parking lot last year, and, in 2014, a group of men who got into a parking lot shootout that killed one and seriously injured two others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police reports from dozens of stores suggest the number of petty crimes committed on Walmart properties nationwide this year will be in the hundreds of thousands. But people dashing out the door with merchandise is the least troubling part of Walmart’s crime problem. More than 200 violent crimes, including attempted kidnappings and multiple stabbings, shootings, and murders, have occurred at the nation’s 4,500 Walmarts this year, or about one a day, according to an analysis of media reports.”*\n",

      "description:  Egypt has state news where the government directly directly hires and controls the message. They have decided to suspend several female anchors until they lose sufficient weight. Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, hosts of The Young Turks, break it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. http://tytnetwork.com/join\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The state TV broadcaster in Egypt has sparked outrage after reportedly suspending eight of its female anchors and instructing them to diet. The Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU) has given the women a month to lose weight before they can resume their on-air roles with an “appropriate appearance,” according to the Al-Yawm al-Sabi website.\n",
      "\n",
      "ERTU’s director, Safaa Hegazy, is a former TV anchor herself. The broadcaster is standing by the decision, but says the women’s pay and benefits will not be docked while they are suspended from appearing on the air. Opinions were divided on social media, with some calling the women “bakabouzas” (an Egyptian term for overweight females) and praising Hegazy’s strong decision. The Women’s Center for Guidance and Legal Awareness said the move “violates the constitution.””*\n",

      "On January twenty-sixth, the United Democratic Party’s National Party Council decided that its leadership convention will be held in February 2020. Up to date, there are only two known candidates who have made their political aspirations public. There is Deputy Party Leader Patrick Faber as well as John Saldivar, the area representative for Belmopan and Minister of National Security. Recently, Foreign Minister Wilfred Elrington told News Five that the position of leadership is not reserved for any special person and that he won’t rule out the possibility of contesting the leadership position. We asked Minister Faber about it today.\n",

When asked to respond to the P.U.P.’s umpteenth call for his removal, Elrington said that the demand was futile. According to Elrington, people very close to the Prime Minister and in the U.D.P. camp have called for his removal since 2008. According to Faber, that is not the way he sees it.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the next few days, a group of attorneys are set to file a constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court. The group will be challenging the validity of the Compromis, signed between Belize and Guatemala to end negotiations and take the territorial dispute between both countries to the International Court of Justice for final resolution. On December eighth, 2008 Belize’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Wilfred Elrington and then Guatemalan Foreign Minister, Haroldo Rodas, as well as O.A.S. Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza, signed on to the special agreement at the O.A.S. Headquarters in Washington. Back then, like now, there is outcry over the agreement which had the support from both major political parties. Attorney Richard “Dickie” Bradley says that the Executive did not have the legal authority to sign the binding document without parliamentary approval.\n",

It’s been eleven years since the agreement was signed, the document went through an amendment and the referendum delinked with Guatemala. Despite a low turnout, Guatemala held its referendum in 2018 and voted to go to the I.C.J.  Bradley, who is known to oppose going to the I.C.J., explains his concerns with the Compromis and not knowing the extent of the Guatemalan claim.\n",

      "title:  Republicans Will Regret Blocking An FBI Investigation Into Kavanaugh\n",
      "description:  Republican politicians believed that they were protecting their nominee by not calling for an FBI investigation into his alleged sexual misconduct, but what they’ve really done is shown the entire country just how partisan and corrupt they are. This decision is going to cost them big time in the midterms, as more and more of Kavanaugh’s former defenders jump ship and say that the allegations are probably true. Ring of Fire’s Farron Cousins discusses this.\n",

      "The Republican Party bet all of their chips on Brett Kavanaugh being confirmed for the United States Supreme Court. That was a major gamble and, as of right now, it's looking like it's going to be a major loss for the Republican Party. Specifically, they're decision to not call for an FBI investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh. They actively blocked repeated calls for an FBI investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as many people have pointed out in the last few days, if Kavanaugh was, in fact, innocent, and he wanted to clear his name, why would he, and the Republicans, oppose an FBI investigation? Because if he did nothing wrong, there would be nothing the FBI could find that would make him look bad. So they would exonerate him, clear his name, put everything to rest, then he could sail through confirmation without a care in the world. Other than the four times he committed perjury, which is, obviously, another issue at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "But nonetheless, if you're innocent, why run away from an investigation? Why block an investigation? I mean, same thing applies for Donald Trump with Robert Mueller. Why are you trying to shut it down, if you know you did nothing wrong? The answer, in both cases, is because, obviously, they did something wrong. You don't fear an investigation unless you know that there's something they're going to find. Republicans picked this hill to make their last stand, to block this FBI investigation into their Supreme Court nominee. This is the hill they're going to die on. This is what they took their last stand for and it failed miserably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only do a majority of Americans not approve of Brett Kavanaugh being confirmed for the US Supreme Court. And not only have multiple former allies of Kavanaugh, who originally said there's no way he could have done that. They're now saying, \"I retract my original statement and I change it to, yes, he could have absolutely done that.\" Kavanaugh's losing allies. Republicans are losing the support of the public, as is, Kavanaugh, and it's going to cost them dearly in the midterms. There is no way around it now. Republicans, like I said, they've bet everything on getting Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court. And everything they've tried to do has backfired miserably. They're out there, right now, whining about civility and Democrats not giving their candidate a fair hearing. When did this happen? Merrick Garland. How about then? THat's when it happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you idiots refused to even give him a hearing, so do you dare whine about civility, or breaking practice, or changing the way things work. When you morons are the ones who started it. The Democrats aren't even doing that. Neil Gorsuch went through without a fight. It's just that this guy, because more, and more, and more, and more women come out saying that he attempted to rape them. Yeah, maybe, we've got a few problems with that, as every normal human being should. But that's the hill you chose to die on. That's what you wanted to run on in the midterms. Good luck with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think it's going to go over very well with the voters. I don't think Brett Kavanaugh is ever going to make it to the Supreme Court and, if he does, he's not going to serve on there very long. Because Democrats are already talking about the fact that, if Republicans somehow manage to confirm this guy, when we take power again, we're just going to launch the investigations then. Then impeach him, remove him from the Supreme Court. Then, after that, it's time to move onto Trump. Those are your only options Republicans. This is a mess you created and, now, you've got to live with it.\n",

How many times have we seen this story? And every time we see this story the industry says, \"oh, no, we didn't do that.\" Here's what you find. They find doctors are sent on vacations; doctors are given actual cash advances; doctors are given free medicine to be able to hand out or to sell; doctors are given these dinners where they bring 'em in and they talk about how great their product is. And oh by the way, \"Doc, would you like another drink? And how was the steak?\"\n",

      "We have laws against this. There are laws against this but it seems as if the laws are always ignored. This is another situation with a drug called Humira. Humira was what ...\n",

      "Rheumatoid arthritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rheumatoid arthritis, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a repeat of that, isn't it?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is, you could take the name AbbVie out of the title here and replace it with Merck or Pfizer or any of the other big ones because they all do this. We had discussed a few months ago just how pervasive this problem really is in medicine and it's almost to the point where patients need to second guess what their doctors are prescribing. I know that's a scary thought and it's not all doctors, but when you have so much money coming in from big pharma, even after they've lobbied and donated to campaigns, there's still so much left over to hand out to these doctors just so they get the edge on the prescriptions with something like Humira cuz there's a million different rheumatoid arthritis drugs out there. But they want Humira to be the blockbuster right now so that's what they push.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me put it into perspective, okay? I could go through virtually every major lawsuit that this firm has handled where a pharmaceutical is on the market killing people. And every time we see that this same story will be part of the story. Let's take testosterone ... okay, testosterone killing people by the dozens from stroke and heart attack. What they did with those doctors is they had junkets for 'em. There's no other way to describe it. It might be a ... the junket might be in the same city, but it's at a resort and we're gonna send you here to the resort to educate you about the problems of low testosterone, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "So they get there on Friday afternoon, they leave on Sunday. In between they have three or four parties, the dinners are spectacular, the little gifts they give away are spectacular, all of the deatilers come in, the detailers are the sales people working in that area and they give their little presentations and we wanna meet you a little later doctor. What we find out, yeah, that's going on when the company knows. Absolutely the companies absolutely know in almost every case that they're having to do that because the pharmaceutical is defective. Whether it's testosterone that we've talked about, whether it is ... there's Invokana, they did the same thing with Invokana. They did the same thing with two or three different birth control pills when there was no need at all to have another birth control pills but you would have these doctor junkets where you convince the doctor ... yeah, this is a great example, isn't it? You convince the doctors that Yaz is different, Yaz is gonna clear up people's complexion, it's gonna help 'em lose weight ... this is what they were telling the doctors.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was a lie. But the doctor is willing to buy into that because they're having a good time, they're making a little extra here, a little extra there. What's your take?\n",

      "So Monday was pretty dramatic, right? I mean, we had Rod Rosenstein allegedly resign and then head over to the White House to allegedly be fired only for nothing at all to happen. Now, during that time that Rod Rosenstein was in the White House, a lot of people were already gearing up. They said, \"Get ready, folks. We're going to have to take to the streets,\" which was absolutely accurate if Trump had fired Rosenstein, but it turns out he just wanted to talk to him, allegedly, according to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, about recent news stories. Those recent news stories obviously being the New York Times report from late last Friday that said Rosenstein had considered wearing a wire to record Donald Trump and even joked about invoking the 25th Amendment, a story that really raised eyebrows, not because Rosenstein would say these things, but because the person who leaked it to the New York Times obviously had to have been a close ally of Donald Trump and was trying to get Rosenstein fired.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's actually theories out there that it may have been Trump himself who not only authorized this leak but possibly even created the story in order to give himself cover or some kind of excuse in order to fire Rod Rosenstein. Now their next meeting's been pushed to Thursday, so as of right now, Rod Rosenstein, still the deputy attorney general of the United States, that may all change on Thursday, but you know what else happens on Thursday? That's the day that Dr. Christine Ford is supposed to go and give her testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, to tell her story of the alleged sexual assault that took place at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh against her nearly 35 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "What better way to distract the public from your embattled Supreme Court nominee than to fire the man overlooking the Robert Mueller special prosecutor investigation? That is a very likely scenario. Obviously we have to wait till Thursday to find out if that's going to happen, but here's what happens if Rosenstein does in fact get fired. First and foremost, it's going to give the special prosecutors even more evidence of obstruction of justice. I mean, that's going to be a really stupid move on behalf of Donald Trump, which makes it all the more likely that he's going to do it because he's a very stupid human being.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Rosenstein gets fired, the person that's going to take over is Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who will likely be forced to recuse himself because he used to work at the law firm Jones Day that's actually representing Donald Trump in the Robert Mueller probe, so if he stays on there's a huge conflict of interest, so it's likely that he would be forced to recuse himself. He's actually already recused himself from multiple things within the Trump Administration because of his connection to his old law firm and other various connections he has, so therefore it would then go to Steve Engel, who heads the department's elite and secretive office of legal counsel. This is a guy that worked in the George W. Bush Administration. He's a hard right guy, but as we've seen from most former members of the Bush Administration, not exactly a Donald Trump loyalist, so it's iffy on what we would get from him.\n",

      "So this week isn't off to a really good start for Republican Senator Ted Cruz, and unfortunately for him, it's only Tuesday. Basically what happened, one of the things that happened, I guess, was that Ted Cruz was on a flight, and an eagle-eyed passenger was able to snap a photo of Ted Cruz just sitting despondently in his seat staring at a picture of his opponent Beto O'Rourke. He's just sitting there, just looking at it. I mean, he doesn't even look angry. He's looking longingly at this photo on his phone of Beto O'Rourke. Now, a lot of Ted Cruz's defenders have come out and said, \"He's just reading an article about Beto O'Rourke.\" Um, okay, but we can see the phone, and he's just looking at a picture. There's not words with it. It's just a picture of Beto O'Rourke. He's not reading anything. He's just sitting there confused wondering why his own campaign is going down in flames. But when you also look at the pictures, you also have to look and see how terrified the fellow passengers behind Ted Cruz look because they're sitting so close to Ted Cruz.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, obviously a very weird picture. You have a lot of people out there saying, \"Yes, it's weird, but why is that news?\" It's news because Ted Cruz is a super creepy guy who tends to do super creepy things, and he actually has a good shot at retaining his Senate seat where he can serve for at least another six years doing super creepy things to the United States of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is actually some real harder, better news about Ted Cruz that came out. Last night he and his wife Heidi were at a very fancy dinner in Washington, D.C., nice restaurant, and Cruz was confronted by people, actual sexual assault survivors came up to him and asked him about Brett Kavanaugh. They confronted him. They were not pushy or super angry. They wanted to know what his position is as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Brett Kavanaugh, whether or not he was going to believe the accusers, whether or not he was going to even listen to them, and Ted Cruz would not give an answer, and in fact, ended up getting his wife and leaving the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, they got chased out of there because Ted Cruz was so scared about having to answer a question about a man who he's known for 20 years, he and Kavanaugh actually pretty good friends, and he wouldn't even answer that question to a woman who was a survivor of sexual assault. So, yeah I think it's okay to mock Ted Cruz for sitting there looking longingly at a photo of Beto O'Rourke when we know that he doesn't give anybody else in this country any respect whatsoever unless he thinks it's going to help him politically. So, mock away because if anybody deserves it, it's Ted Cruz.\n",

      "This past Friday Donald Trump decided to jump into the fray trying to defend his supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. And he did it the only way he knows how, to get on Twitter and start attacking the woman accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Ford. His Tweets were so bad and so damaging for his own nominee and the Republican Party that Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell had to get on the phone with Donald Trump, according to reports, that afternoon and say, \"Please stop tweeting about this because you're making the situation so much worse.\" Mitch McConnell, the man without a backbone, a spineless republican suck up actually decided to get on the phone and say, \"You're making things worse. Could you please stop?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, trump sent out several tweets about Dr Christine Ford, the woman accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, but I'm just gonna read one. This is the most disgusting. It is, \"I have no doubt that if the attack on Dr Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local law enforcement authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time and place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the reason that's so disgusting is because he's trying to play it both ways and make it sound like, \"I'm not saying if she ... I mean, if she has those bring them forward and we'll evaluate them.\" But he's also saying, \"If it had happened she would have filed a report and she didn't, so obviously it didn't happen.\" He is sitting there, as he has done so many times, including with the 19 plus woman who have credibly accused him of sexual misconduct, trying to act like it's a lie. But he's trying to do it a little more diplomatically than usual, which also leads me to believe that maybe Trump himself isn't the one who tweeted this out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, Mitch McConnell had to get on the phone and say, \"Could you please not say these things. We're already between a rock and hard place here. We don't need you making it worse.\" Well guess what Mitch, Donald Trump was literally saying the exact same thing that the rest of your republicans on the senate judiciary committee have already been saying. Lindsay Graham said that it doesn't matter what Dr Ford testifies and says during her hearing. It's not gonna change his vote. I mean, your own buddy Lindsay Graham said, \"No matter what she says, I don't care. I'm still voting to confirm him.\" Other republicans have said, \"This is obviously a democratic plot. This didn't really happen. They're wasting our time.\" And you're just only mad at Trump? You're not standing up to anybody. You're standing up to the one guy that you don't have to deal with on a daily basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "How about you go tell the other republicans on the judiciary committee that what they're saying about this woman and these accusations is absolutely insane, and they need to shut their damn mouths until she is allowed to come in and give her testimony. Or better yet, tell them to shut their mouths until after we get an FBI investigation into this thing. You can't just find one guy who works in a different building, Donald Trump, and say, \"Oh, you got me so mad. I'm gonna ... I'm gonna stand up to you. Could you stop making things worse,\" and then ignore the guys working down the hall from you who are making things so much worse for you.\n",

      "A plateau is generally at least three to seven weeks where workout or weight loss seems to stop, but you can seek some help pushing past the plateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is probably no one that gets asked more about pushing through a plateau than Dave Rechtin. He's an athletic trainer at  G&G Fitness Equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He says if the treadmill is your traditional workout and you can't seem to move the scale or shrink a size, mixing it up might matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you're a treadmill person, it's really almost about moving on to anything else that's going to work different muscle groups, work them differently. Rowers are really popular nowadays,\" Rechtin said.\n",

      "Rowers use the whole body, including your core. It also gives you a total body workout for aerobic capacity and calorie burning. The new, hot thing, however, is the adaptive motion trainer.\n",

      "\"It's a great workout. You can never get the same workout twice on it,\" Rechtin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to that, however, Rechtin points out that there are a few other things you have to do on top of the aerobic activity to get an all-encompassing, good fitness plan that really can help you push past the plateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is some form of strength training. Adaptable weights can help build muscle, and a fit muscle burns more calories when you are at rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "If weights aren't your thing, there's something called a vibration plate. It's a platform for strength that also helps balance.\n",

      "The high importance Canadian GDP for May will be available at a half past noon GMT as well. Output expanded by just one tenth of a percent in April and this was the third monthly gain in a row.\n",

      "Pound/Dollar has walked in a relatively narrow range of 41 pips, while attracting 43% less than typical funds. Sentiment of the traders is neutral, long positions are up by 8%. Both the passive trading and relatively flat rate movement are limiting factors.\n",
      "Dollar/Yen rose slowly by 28 pips early in the session, but the pair moved sideways afterwards. Traded volume is average and sentiment of the traders is neutral, 13% long. Early rise has provided some profit chances for bullish market players.\n",
      "Pound/Yen has been trending slowly higher, but most of the gains were given up after 8 AM. This pair sees less than half of the monthly average funds and most of them have been in long positions. Both the passive trading and the flat rate movement suggest no major profits or losses are likely.\n",
      "Euro/Yen has been mostly climbing up and rise puts the pair point 31% in the green. Traded volume is extremely low and most of the funds have been in long positions. The rate did go per those expectations and a more active trading approach would have increased profits.\n",

      "description:  CARROLLTON, Ga. - A rookie driver for the Carroll County Fire Department is being blamed for an accident that left an Alabama woman badly injured.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it turns out, the driver was not certified to be behind the wheel of the fire truck or, even more, to be a firefighter. But perhaps surprisingly, Carroll County authorities okayed that decision and said they've employed uncertified firefighters on their trucks for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Labor Day accident happened at the intersection of Highway 27 and Highway 5 near Roopville in the southern part of the county. James and Peggy Hicks were heading back from a weekend visit to Pigeon Forge, TN, driving to their home in Opelika, AL, when their Nissan Rogue crossed through on a green light. They were going around 50 MPH they estimated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I heard something and I glanced over in my mirror and I couldn't see anything,\" James remembered.\n",
      "Carroll County fire accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peggy said she saw the fire truck sitting to her right, not moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I glanced back up I heard my wife scream,\" James said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just screamed at James, he's coming out!\" said Peggy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire engine pulled into their path. James said he swerved to try to avoid the collision but could not. The crash caused their airbags to deploy. James blacked out, slowly regaining consciousness to find his wife bleeding, her left foot twisted horribly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was thinking to myself is this where I'm going to die?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peggy and James Hicks recall the accident that broke her ankle and two of his toes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peggy would be airlifted to the Atlanta Medical Center with windshield glass still in her hair. Her ankle was broken. So were two of James' toes. The fire engine had been heading to an emergency medical call. Suddenly, a different emergency was right in front of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The full investigation is not finished, but an initial report by the Georgia State Patrol cited the driver of the fire truck, Cody Stinecypher, with failure to yield. The Hicks' would later learn this was only Stinecypher's second emergency call.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're lucky to be alive,\" said Peggy while sitting in her living room, her foot propped up and supported with screws and a heavy brace. \"He had no business being under that wheel. No business at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with their sirens and flashing lights engaged, fire engines are not allowed to automatically ignore our traffic laws. The driver can only run a red light when they're sure the intersection is clear. Often that comes with experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stinecypher started with the department in May and got a driver's license that allows him to drive large vehicles like a fire truck. But at the time of the accident, he still had not begun classes to be a certified firefighter or driver. Yet Carroll County knowingly let him drive to that emergency call on Labor Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Labor Day accident was Cody Stinecypher's second emergency call as a driver. He was hired in June but had yet to start firefighter school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deputy chief Bud Benefield said they routinely let firefighters drive in real-life conditions before they're certified. Stinecypher had already logged 230 miles of non-emergency driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It appeared everything else would have been normal with that phasing him into some emergency response, to let him make some emergency calls,\" Benefield explained. \"Unfortunately, this one didn't work out for the best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gordon Henderson, the head of the Georgia Firefighters Standards and Training Council, called Carroll County's practice \"highly unusual,\" but said the decision to have non-certified people driving on emergency calls is up to the individual fire departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "We asked deputy chief Benefield if the Labor Day accident had his department rethinking that practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we're always looking for ways that we can improve,\" he answered. Benefield said this is the first time he can remember one of his rookie drivers was involved in an accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carroll County deputy fire chief Bud Benefield said his department has used uncertified fire truck drivers \"for years\" to run emergency calls as part of their training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in Opelika, family members built a ramp so Peggy Hicks can get in and out of their home. The couple says they're also planning to sue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's no undoing what's done to them,\" said their attorney Ross Massey. \"But certainly we want to make sure that the fire department recognizes their wrongs and that this never happened again.\"\n",

      "description:  Frustrated homeowners celebrated the arrest of the owner of a DeKalb tree-cutting service they blame for leaving their yards an eyesore and public danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Members of the DeKalb County Sheriff's Fugitive Squad took Angela Hodges into custody Tuesday, three months after a series of criminal theft warrants were issued against her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The charges involve four different homeowners who claim Hodges took money up front to take down trees or remove stumps, then failed to show up to do any work at all. One complainant said he paid Hodges $5000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many others filed civil suits against Hodges after she cut down the trees but then failed to come back to remove the debris.\n",
      "\n",
      "People like Patricia Callahan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is not a yard,\" she told me as we walked through a backyard littered with giant logs and heavy branches. \"I should make money for the movies the way my yard is looking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Disaster movies?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Disaster movies,\" she agreed. \"Real scary ones that I don't watch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Callahan worried about snakes or what might happen if her grandchildren try to play outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's really scary,\" she stressed. \"I don't know what to do now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't supposed to look that way. In January, Callahan signed a contract with Don's Tree Experts: $2000 all up front to cut down two dying trees and haul away the debris.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the company only did half the job, Patricia tried calling owner Angela Hodges. According to the Better Business Bureau complaint Callahan would eventually file, Hodges \"always had the same excuse, truck in shop or it has rained or is going to rain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She later sued but couldn't find Hodges to serve her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Months went by. The horror movie continued to play. As it turns out, in more than one theater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other Don's Tree Experts customers filed their own lawsuits, including Pattie Seymour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything that Angela Hodges I believe that have said is a bunch of lies,\" Seymour told a magistrate judge in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "She explained she and her husband gave Hodges two checks totaling $7200. According to their lawsuit, Hodges left their yard a disaster, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The couple would win a $4000 judgment. But then Ms. Seymour's husband passed away, leaving her to try to go back to court alone to try to collect on the judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's hard to find out even where she live,\" she explained to the judge through tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hodges also failed to show for that hearing as ordered by DeKalb magistrate judge Matthew McCoyd. Instead, she sent an attorney who asked for a continuance because she hadn't been able to review the case with her client.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The only reason you can't review it with your client is your client's not here!\" pointed out the exasperated judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge told the attorney he wanted Hodges to come before him to face possible criminal contempt charges for failing to appear. That was in June. But instead of going to court, Hodges went on to run her company for the next three months.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, until Hodges was arrested this week. Even though she wasn't one of the customers who filed criminal charges, Patricia Callahan -- the Atlanta woman who says her backyard is the perfect set for a disaster movie --  showed up for the video-conferenced hearing, satisfied with Hodge's orange jumpsuit costume change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was glad to see her in that,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Curtis Miller set bond at $5000 and ordered Hodges to stay away from any tree business work while the cases are pending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Callahan still hopes she will get back her money, but felt the low bond and job restriction was not enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No cause I don't trust her,\" she explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "TIPS\n",
      "\n",
      "* it's risky to pay in full for a tree removal job. Most reputable companies ask for a 50% deposit and will allow you to put it on a credit card. That way if there's a problem, you can dispute the charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "* do not confuse Angela Hodges' company -- Don's Tree Experts -- with a company that has a similar name. That one is called Don's Tree Service. They’ve been in business for years in DeKalb. The two companies are not connected.\n",

      "description:  Another day, another report of implosion in the Congress party. Many of the party's popular faces seem to be upset this time around, starting with former Haryana chief minister Bhupender Singh Hooda, who can be seen in a video allegedly asking where is the party. This video is being shared by people close to Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar. Another senior Haryana Congress face Ashok Tanwar accuses his own party of taking money for seats and also wants Sonia Gandhi to take back all his responsibilities. In Maharashtra, Sanjay Nirupam is miffed that his choice of candidate was rejected. He says if the party does not value him, then he may think of leaving the party. Juxtapose this with the BJP that has removed many sitting MLAs, even ministers on grounds of incompetence and a resurgent Shiv Sena under the young leadership of Aaditya Thackeray. So where does this all leave the Congress party just ahead of elections?\n",

      "description:  Virat Kohli fails in DRS calls, India get 17 out of 55 right in 7 Tests. He may have been a vocal advocate of Decision Review System (DRS) but Indian captain Virat Kohli's dismal success ratio indicates that calling for referrals is not exactly his 'calling card'. The five-match England series against India was start of India using Decision Review System, something they had strong reservations during Mahendra Singh Dhoni's era. But in the seven Test matches since the start of DRS usage, India have got only 17 correct decisions out of the 55 referrals that they have taken. This comprise both batting and fielding statistic and the success percentage comes to a mere 30.9 percent. The problem with India has been more to do with referrals while fielding where they have got only 10 correct out of 42 that they have taken in seven Test matches. While batting it has been much better with 7 successful reviews out of 13 taken.\n",

The three-year-old mongrel dog named Heng Heng had been missing from his home for two day before a locals heard him yelping from the abandoned pit in Chiang Mai, Thailand, on Monday (30/09) afternoon. The well is 17ft deep which made it impossible for the locals to help him out so they called for help. Firefighter came with a ladder to climb down and grab the dog but he was frightened and growled at the rescuer - before retreating into a pipe. The officer tried to use an anaesthetic to sedate the dog but he failed after he bit him and broke the syringe. Eventually, the dog was coaxed out by his owner who arrived at the well to help.\n",
